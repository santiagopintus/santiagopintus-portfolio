To do:
- Remove the padding of the hero grid items in mobile
- Create a footer with contact info, social media links, and copyright (add developed by Santiago Pintus with link to portfolio)
- Project carousel items don't fit the screen in mobile too wide
- Hamburger menu button should be 48x48px for better accessibility and the icon 24px centered
- Add an Experience section in the home with a vertical timeline of jobs and education I imagine a dot that is centered vertically in the viewport and as you scroll the dot is fixed and travels through the timeline
