To do:
- The dot of experience and education appears from the beginning when the section is not in view. It should appear when the top of the line is in the center (at the same position of the dot). Also it should match the opacity of the line (low at the beginning, high when in the center).
- The dot of experience and education should appear in mobile as well.
- Encountered two children with the same key, `2`. Keys should be unique so that components maintain their identity across updates. Non-unique keys may cause children to be duplicated and/or omitted — the behavior is unsupported and could change in a future version. At <ExperienceTimeline call in page.tsx (and the same for a key "1")
- Remove facebook and instagram links from ALL parts of the app. Also my email is santiagopintus@gmail.com update it.
- Add a small message in the footer to invite other devs to fork and star the repo on GitHub.
